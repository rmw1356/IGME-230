# Story

### You play as a shadow, and have to escape from the sun's light as it rises! If you can't escape the light, you'll disappear!

# Gameplay

### *Sunrise* is an **infinite runner**, where the player moves at a consistent speed and must avoid obstacles as they run by them. The only goal is to survive as long as possible!

# Esthetics
### The main character, as well as the floor, objects, and background, will all be pixel art. The music will be a consistent, high energy chiptune theme.
